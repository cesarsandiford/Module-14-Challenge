Summary:

After having both models SVM vs Logistic regression, we can conclude that we see different results when having these two models.
For SVM we can see the strategy return would be more favorable for the investing strategy based on the graph results. We have higher returns than the Actual returns.







SVM Model Prediction:

For Logistics Regression model is quite bad that we start losing the returns when ending the trading period, therefore, SVM would be more ideal when trading for higher return vs the actual returns.
